# Quadratic Roots Calculator

A simple C program to calculate the roots of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\).

## Description

This program prompts the user to enter the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) of the quadratic equation. It calculates the discriminant and finds the roots based on it. If the roots are real, it displays them; if imaginary, it notifies the user.

## Features

- Input integer coefficients from the user
- Calculate the discriminant
- Compute and display real roots if they exist
- Handle and indicate imaginary roots
- Clean and straightforward command-line interface

## Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., gcc)
- Basic understanding of compiling and running C programs
